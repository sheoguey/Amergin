This is the WHITEBOARD FILE:

Things to REVIEW:
1. What/where is "origin"
2. What is "master"
3. How to create a local branch (i.e. funky_chicken)
   From within the home directory of the repo to be branched, type "git branch <newbranchname>"
   	to enter that branch, "git checkout newbranchname"
         to enter any branch, "git checkout <branchname>"
         to show branches   "git branch [-a or -r]"   without switch, it lists local branches
4. How to push a local branch (other than master) to repo
5. Be comfortable with:
  git log
  git status
  git add
  git commit (-m '<MESSAGE HERE>')
  git branch
  git checkout -b << new branch
  BE CAREFUL: git checkout
  git pull --rebase
  git push (origin master)
6. Create a pull request
7. Merge in a pull request (or ask Alan to do that after it's pushed)

Questions:
* different user.name and user.email for personal vs groupon usage on same laptop
origin is the remote original repo(set of files); master is my local copy of origin that I pulled/copied

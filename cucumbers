Today, I transplanted a seedling cucumber into a permanent bed.
I went away... to secure my tools and get water to finish up.
Preparing to water the new garden, I turned to corner, only to see that the Cat
had flung the fresh soil and the tender seedling aside
and was preparing to make his own deposit.

"Cat!", I cried!! "Get out of there!"
Off he went and dumped his load 8 feet away... it was a process that, 
apparently, could not be stopped.

I set down the watering can, re-set the seedling with more soil, fertilizer (purchased,
not donated by the Cat) and left HIM a present.

Next time, he gets a nose full of cayenne.
